Title: Big data-guided investigation of microbe-derived peptides associated with human health
Speaker: Dengwei ZHANG
Abstract: The human-associated microbiota produces a diverse array of small bioactive metabolites that participate in the cross-talk of microbiota-host and microbial community, thereby regulating human host physiology. The recent surge in (meta)genomics data has opened new avenues for studying microbe-derived metabolites at both single species and community levels. Guided by big data analysis, our research focuses on decoding microbe-derived peptides, a class of abundant metabolites in the human microbiome, and their potential functions. By systematically investigating the biosynthetic potential of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), we have discovered their broad diversity, abundance, and distribution in the human microbiome. Analysis of multiple disease case-control cohorts indicates their possible association with human disease, for example autoinducer peptides that can inhibit pathogen biofilm formation in vitro. We also examine antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins), the most common metabolites of lactic acid bacteria. By improving existing tools, we demonstrate the widespread distribution of unmodified bacteriocins throughout the bacterial tree of life, which are generally niche-specific and enriched in the human microbiome. Guided by meta-omics analysis, we experimentally validate the underappreciated bacteriocin biosynthetic potential of gut commensal species. This presentation will showcase how big data and multi-omics analysis can guide the exploration of microbe-derived peptides in the human microbiota.
